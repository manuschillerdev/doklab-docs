# Getting Started

Welcome to doklab! This guide will help you get up and running with doklab in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before installing doklab, ensure you have:

- **Docker** 24.0+ installed and running
- **Docker Compose** v2.20+ (comes with Docker Desktop)
- A Linux, macOS, or WSL2 environment
- **Git** for version control

## Network Mode Decision

doklab supports two network modes. Choose based on your use case:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['Tailscale (Private)', 'Cloudflare (Public)']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Best for**: Internal tools, development environments, private services

    - Services accessible only via your Tailscale network
    - Automatic HTTPS via Tailscale certificates
    - No public internet exposure
    - Simple setup with just an auth key

    ```bash
    doklab init --ts-authkey tskey-auth-xxxxx
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Best for**: Public websites, APIs, production deployments

    - Services accessible from the public internet
    - Automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
    - Cloudflare Tunnel for secure connections
    - Requires a domain and Cloudflare account

    ```bash
    doklab init --cloudflare --domain example.com --cf-token TOKEN
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  Not sure which to choose? Start with **Tailscale** for development and internal tools. You can always switch to Cloudflare later for public-facing services.
</Callout>
